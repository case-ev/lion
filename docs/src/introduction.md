# What is lion?

lion is a library whose goal is to provide a simulator of the operation of a lithium-ion battery, considering both electrical and thermal behavior, as well as the relations between both of them. It does this by considering a series of models that dictate how electrical operation affects heat generation, and how the cell's temperatures affect electrical performance.
